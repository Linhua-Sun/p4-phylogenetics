This makes the fastReducedRF module, which is for fast calculation of RF distances between input trees and a supertree.  It is meant to be used by p4.STMcmc.py

This needs boost-python and boost dynamic-bitset.
It also needs PyUblas, from http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyublas   Using PyUblas, we can use the p4.Tree.postOrder numpy array directly in fastReducedRF.

To build the thing, do 

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

and look for error messages.  If you get error messages, it probably can't find something that it needs, which might be corrected by adjusting the setup.py file.  If it works, you get fastReducedRF.so, which you can move into your python path, eg in the p4 modules directory.

Notes added 2013-04-01.  I was having trouble building it, but got it to build again on ubuntu 12.04 LTS server, by doing this ---

Install boost (with boost_python) via apt-get

Then install PyUBlas
 ./configure.py --boost-python-libname=boost_python-py27
 make
 sudo make install
It installed in 
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyUblas-2011.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg

Notes added 2014-09-03.  I was able to able to build it on the Mac again, using python, numpy, and boost from homebrew, and pyublas from pip.
