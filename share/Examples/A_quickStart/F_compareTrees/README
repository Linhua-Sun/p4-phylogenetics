# To draw the trees to the screen, do this:
p4 -d t*

# Then, to compare the topologies,
#     $ p4 t*                           # Read in both trees
#     p4> tA = var.trees[0]             # Name the first one
#     p4> tB = var.trees[1]             # Name the second one
#     p4> print tA.topologyDistance(tB) # Symmetric difference
#     0                                 # Zero means they are the same
