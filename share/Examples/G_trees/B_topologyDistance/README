# This is a demo of 3 different topologyDistance metrics.  It is taken
# from Felsenstein's book, page 529 ff.

# The first is the symmetric difference.  Its that number of splits
# that one tree has that the other does not, plus the number of splits
# that the other tree has that the one does not.  It is the same as
# the unweighted Robinson-Foulds distance.

# The weighted Robinson-Foulds distance and the BLD are metrics for
# weighted trees.  The example is taken from Felsenstein's book, page
# 532, but note that there is a small error there-- in the diagram on
# the right of Figure 30.8, the branch length to the AB clade is shown
# as 0.3, but in the table below, and in the calculations, it is 0.2.
# This is a known typo, and it should be 0.3, which makes the rf
# distance 1.05, and the branch score 0.1925.  See 
# http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/book/typos.html
