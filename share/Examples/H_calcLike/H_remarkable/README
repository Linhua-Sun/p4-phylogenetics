# In the simulation, I make a star tree, with 5 equal branches, all
# length 0.3.  The root has an equal frequency of bases, but the
# sequences on the branches evolve under an f81 model with a
# composition (0.4, 0.1, 0.1).  So the sequences start out with equal
# base frequencies but become AT-rich as they evolve.  Since they
# approach the model composition assymptotically, the composition of
# the sequences never actually gets there.  They only become slightly
# AT-rich over the course of their evolution.

# The analysis has no access to the parameters of the simulation; all
# it has are the data.  Yet it is able to correctly estimate all the
# simulation parameters.

# The cool thing about this is that although all the sequences have a
# composition of approx (0.31, 0.19, 0.19), p4 is able to correctly
# estimate both the (0.4, 0.1, 0.1) composition params for the branch
# model, but also the equal composition params for the root model.
# All of these composition parameters are outside of the range of the
# observed data (!).  Remarkable.

# One lesson here is that if you are dealing with hetero composition,
# it is best to estimate the charfreq, rather than using empirical
# charfreq.
