# Grouped amino acids
# ===================

# This shows how to put amino acids into groups.  One motivation is
# that you might suspect that there is saturation within the groups
# but not so much between the groups.  Its rather like RY-recoding of
# DNA, where you end up analysing only transversions.  One big
# advantage to grouping aa's is that you can then optimize the
# rMatrix, which is not only computationally expensive with the full
# set of 20 aa's, but often there is not enough data with which to do
# it well.

# Here I have used Dayhoff groups. Dayhoff groups are:

# c
# stpag
# ndeq
# hrk
# milv
# fyw


# One way to do it would be to use the nexus 'format' command to do
# the recoding.  This does it:

#  format datatype=standard symbols="123456" equate="c=1 s=2 t=2 p=2
#        a=2 g=2 n=3 d=3 e=3 q=3  h=4 r=4 k=4 m=5 i=5 l=5 v=5  f=6 y=6 
#        w=6"  gap=-;

# However, that makes for slow likelihood evaluations, because each
# equate must be evaluated, which takes a few extra calculations.  A
# better way to do it would be to hard recode the data, which is the
# way it is done here.  (An additional advantage, besides the speed,
# is that if there are no gaps or ambiguities then it allows the
# calculation of the unconstrained likelihood.)
