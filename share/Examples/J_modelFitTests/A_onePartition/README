# I use a model that is tree-hetero for composition, so the data is
# compositionally heterogeneous.  Naturally, tests of compositional
# homogeneity (X^2 test) say that it is not homogeneous.  But a more
# important question is whether the hetero data fits the hetero model,
# and here I show that it does fit.  That is reasonable, because I
# simulated the "original" data under a known model, and I evaluated
# those data with that model.  In a more realistic scenario I would of
# course not know what the true model was.
