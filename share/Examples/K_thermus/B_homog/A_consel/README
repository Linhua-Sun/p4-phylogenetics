# This uses Shimo's consel set of programs to do sh, au, etc tests.
# Of course the programs need to be installed.

# The consel() method is a method of the Trees class, but the trees
# should all be optimized.  So before we do consel(), we have to
# define models and optimize the likelihood.  Here we do not save the
# optimized trees, but it would be usual to do that.  After optimizing
# both trees (with separate models), we make a Trees() object, and
# call consel().

# Do this:
p4 s.py
rm conselOut
