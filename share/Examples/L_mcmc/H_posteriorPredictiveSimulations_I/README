# Here we look at the Thermus dataset and ask whether the composition
# part of the tree-homogeneous model fits the data.  To do that we do
# an MCMC with Mcmc(..., simulate=2), which writes a file of X^2
# values from simulations made at the sampled points in the MCMC.
# Then the X^2 stat is obtained from the original data.  It is
# evaluated relative to the simulation values using a tail area
# probability test.  The P_t is zero; that shows that the composition
# of a homogeneous GTR+G model does not fit the data.
