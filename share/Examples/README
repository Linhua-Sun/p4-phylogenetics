Using the Examples
==================

It is recommended that you make a copy of these Examples, and work on
the copy.  That way the original is left untouched.

Sometimes there is a README file, that tells you what sequence of
commands to do to make the examples happen.  In other cases there is
just a script (s.py or sSomething.py) that you can execute with p4.
