========================
Scripts for common tasks
========================

This is a cook book of reminders, suggestions, and points of departure
for customization.  You can copy and paste these into your own files.
Or you can use the p4 recipes function, ``func.recipes()``, to write new
files.

In these scripts I suggest variations, often by enclosing the variation
in an ``if 1:`` block to turn it on, or an ``if 0:`` block to turn it off.
Hopefully the meaning is clear and the (sometimes mutually exclusive)
possibilities are obvious.
